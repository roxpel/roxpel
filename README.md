## Hi there, I'm Roxane 👋👩🏽‍💻  

I'm a data scientist who loves turning complex ideas into products, strategies, and stories that actually work.  
I’ve lived in 6 countries, speak 3 languages fluently, and found my favorite one in code.

My background's in big tech, insights, and storytelling. At TikTok, I led research and insights across a $250M+ market and founded Skeeva, an AI-powered skincare coach. I’m especially drawn to building things that connect data with real human impact.

Let’s connect, collaborate, or just talk ideas! 🧠
